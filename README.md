# password-strength-checker
Password Strength Checker is a simple Python project that evaluates how strong a password is based on multiple security conditions — such as length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. It helps users create stronger passwords by giving a clear strength rating (Weak, Moderate, or Strong) and a detailed feedback report.
